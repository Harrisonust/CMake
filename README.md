# Cmake notes

## Commands
`cmake -S [source_path] -B [build_path]`

## Folder structure
* `bin/` - a folder that contains the compiled .DLL file or (sometimes) a .lib or the executable application or .exe file — the “binary”
* `include/` - a folder that contains the publicly distributed .h (header files) for a library to be included in another application, required to use a library or DLL, normally put **pure .h files** in
* `lib/` - a folder that contains **statically linkable**, **precompiled code** and is part of a library, library-builders mostly code thier librarise in this folder
* `doc/` - all those nifty **manuals** programmers hate to write, or generated ones from the output of a source documentation utility like Doxygen, or a README file, or the .man files for Linux “man” command, or an offline website so you would see .html files
* `build/` - a folder that is sometimes there for holding onto **build scripts**, half-built code, other stuff related to the compilation process, usually its generated by a utility or the compiler. There are other names for this folder on each platform
* `src/` - this is where the source code is, **users edit this stuff most frequently** (probably), and it may have sub-folders
* `data/` - some applications come with “sample data” or “test data” that usually sits in here and is accessed by the application in the bin/ folder
* `examples/` - some libraries come with a set of applications that test out various “units” of the “system” and also demonstrate usage
* `contrib/` - this used to mean “user-contributed snippets” or source code given to the primary author or authors for use or to extend an open-source project [3](or even a closed source one), though the “contrib” idea hit its popularity peak a long time ago, in a time when not everyone had a source versioning control utility like git

## Commom CMake functions
### Setting
* `cmake_minuim_required(VERSION [X.x])`<br />
Set the cmake minimun required version, compile will aborted for cmake lower than this specified version
* `set([var] [value])`<br />
Set `var` = `value`
* `project([project_name] [VERSION X.x])`<br />
CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = `project_name`<br />
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = `X.x`<br />
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR = `X`<br />
CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR = `x`<br />

### Compiling
* `add_executable([target] [src])`<br />
Compile `src` into an executable `target`

* `add_subdirectory([dir])`<br />
Told the Cmake system there is a subdirectory which contains antoher sub-CMakeList.txt file and that will handle the build process of that subdir.

* `add_library([target] [STATIC|SHARED|MODULE] [src])`<br />
It is called inside the sub-CMakeList.txt, and it will compile the `src` into the `target` library 
    * `STATIC` - statically linking(linking at compile time)
    * `SHARED` - dynamically linking(linking at running time)
    * `MODULE` - ??

* `target_include_directories([target] [PUBLIC|PRIVATE] [include_dir_path])`<br />
Include headers inside `include_dir_path` into an executable `target`
So we could do #include "header.h" in the source code instead of #include "path/header.h"
target_include_directories(...) is required to do the simple #include "whatever.h" without needing to include the folder path in your C++ files

* `target_link_libraries([target] [PUBLIC|PRIVATE] [lib])`<br />
target_link_libraries(...) is required to link the main.cpp's output to the library's output so they can call each other in the build

* `target_link_directories([target] [PUBLIC|PRIVATE] [lib])`<br />
???seems not important

* `configure_file([input] [output])`<br />
Copies an `input` file to an `output` file and substitutes variable values referenced as @VAR@ or ${VAR} in the input file content.

* `install([TARGETS|DIRECTORIES|FILES] [target] [LIBRARY] DESTINATION [path])`<br />
Install `target` to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/`path`
    * `LIBRARY` - install to ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib

## Commom CMake variable list
* `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` - The root source directory
* `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` - The current source directory if using sub-projects and directories.
* `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR` - The source directory of the current cmake project.
* `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR` - The root binary / build directory. This is the directory where you ran the cmake command.
* `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` - The build directory you are currently in.
* `PROJECT_BINARY_DIR` - The build directory for the current project.
* `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` - Prefix path when calling make install
* `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` - c++ standard

#### platform-related
* `UNIX` - for all UNIX-like OS's, including Apple OS X and CygWin
* `WIN32` - for Windows. Prior to 2.8.4 this included CygWin
* `APPLE` - for Apple systems. Note this does not imply the system is Mac OSX, only that APPLE is #defined in C/C++ header files.
* `MINGW` - is TRUE when using the MinGW compiler in Windows
* `MSYS` - is TRUE when using the MSYS developer environment in Windows
* `CYGWIN` - for Windows when using the CygWin version of cmake
